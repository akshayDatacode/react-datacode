simply a piece of source code ignored by the compiler. They are only helpful for a programmer to add a description or additional information about their source code.\n\n             In C++ there are two ways to add comments:\n             \n             //single-line comment\n             /* block comment */\n             The first type will discard everything after the compiler encounters “//”.

As a result of the declaration, we tell the compiler to reserve the space for a variable in the memory according to the data type specified.\n\n             Example:\n             \n             int Result;\n             char c;\n             int a,b,c;\n             All the above are valid declarations. Also, note that as a result of the declaration, the value of the variable is undetermined.\n             \n             Whereas, a definition is an implementation/instantiation of the declared variable where we tie up appropriate value to the declared variable so that the linker will be able to link references to the appropriate entities.\n             \n             From above Example,\n             \n             Result = 10;\n             \n             C = ‘A’;\n             \n             These are valid definitions.`}\n                  />\n                  <QuestionCard\n                    question={`Q #4) Comment on Local and Global scope of a variable.\n\n             `}\n                    answer={`Answer: The scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable remains active i.e. it can be declared, defined or worked with.\n\n             There are two types of scope in C++:\n             \n             Local Scope: A variable is said to have a local scope or is local when it is declared inside a code block. The variable remains active only inside the block and is not accessible outside the code block.\n             Global Scope: A variable has a global scope when it is accessible throughout the program.

Using this operator, we can access the value of the global variable.\n             \n             Example:\n             \n             #include<iostream.h>\n             int x= 10;\n             int main()\n             {\n              int x= 2;\n              cout<<”Global Variable x = “<<::x;\n              cout<<”/nlocal Variable x= “<<x;\n             }\n             Output:\n             \n             Global Variable x = 10\n             local Variable x= 2\n             `}\n                  />\n                  <QuestionCard\n                    question={`Q #7) How many ways are there to initialize an int with a Constant?\n\n             `}\n                    answer={`Answer: There are two ways:\n\n             The first format uses traditional C notation.\n             int result = 10;\n             The second format uses the constructor notation.\n             int result (10);`}\n                  />\n                  <QuestionCard\n                    question={`Q #8) What is a Constant?

They can be divided into integer, decimal, floating-point, character or string constants depending on their data type.\n\n             Apart from the decimal, C++ also supports two more constants i.e. octal (to the base 8) and hexadecimal (to the base 16) constants.\n             \n             Examples of Constants:\n             \n             75 //integer (decimal)\n             0113 //octal\n             0x4b //hexadecimal\n             3.142 //floating point\n             ‘c’ //character constant\n             “Hello, World” //string constant\n             Note: When we have to represent a single character, we use single quotes and when we want to define a constant with more than one character, we use double-quotes.`}\n                  />\n                  <QuestionCard\n                    question={`Q #9) How do you define/declare constants in C++?\n\n             `}\n                    answer={`Answer: In C++, we can define our own constants using the #define preprocessor directive.\n\n             #define Identifier value\n             \n             Example:\n             \n             #include<iostream.h>\n             #define PI 3.142\n             int main ()\n             {\n                              float radius =5, area;\n                              area = PI * r * r;\n                              cout<<”Area of a Circle = “<<area;\n             }\n             Output: Area of a Circle = 78.55\n             \n             As shown in the above example, once we define a constant using #define directive, we can use it throughout the program and substitute its value.\n             \n             We can declare constants in C++ using the “const” keyword. This way is similar to that of declaring a variable, but with a const prefix.\n             \n             Examples of declaring a constant\n             \n             const int pi = 3.142;\n             const char c = “sth”;\n             const zipcode = 411014;\n             \n             In the above examples, whenever the type of a constant is not specified, the C++ compiler defaults it to an integer type.`}\n                  />\n                  <QuestionCard\n                    question={`Q #10) Comment on Assignment Operator in C++.\n\n             `}\n                    answer={`Answer: Assignment operator in C++ is used to assign a value to another variable.\n\n             a = 5;\n             \n             This line of code assigns the integer value 5 to variable a.\n             \n             The part at the left of the =operator is known as an lvalue (left value) and the right as rvalue (right value). Lvalue must always be a variable whereas the right side can be a constant, a variable, the result of an operation or any combination of them.\n             \n             The assignment operation always takes place from the right to left and never at the inverse.\n             \n             One property which C++ has over the other programming languages is that the assignment operator can be used as the rvalue (or part of an rvalue) for another assignment.\n             \n             Example:\n             \n             a = 2 + (b = 5);\n             \n             is equivalent to:\n             \n             b = 5;\n             a = 2 + b;\n             \n             Which means, first assign 5 to variable b and then assign to a, the value 2 plus the result of the previous expression of b(that is 5), leaves a with a final value of 7.\n             \n             Thus, the following expression is also valid in C++:\n             \n             a = b = c = 5;\n             \n             assign 5 to variables a, b and c.`}\n                  />\n                </div>\n              </div>\n\n              <div className=\"row\">\n                <div

Example: Ethernet.\n\n        b) Data Link Layer (Layer 2): At the Data Link layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits and it provides a node to node data transfer. This layer also detects the errors that occurred at Layer 1.\n\n        c) Network Layer (Layer 3): This layer transfers variable length data sequence from one node to another node in the same network. This variable-length data sequence is also known as “Datagrams”.\n\n        d) Transport Layer (Layer 4): It transfers data between nodes and also provides acknowledgment of successful data transmission. It keeps track of transmission and sends the segments again if the transmission fails.\n\n        e) Session Layer (Layer 5): This layer manages and controls the connections between computers. It establishes, coordinates, exchange and terminates the connections between local and remote applications.\n\n        f) Presentation Layer (Layer 6): It is also called as “Syntax Layer”. Layer 6 transforms the data into the form in which the application layer accepts.\n\n        g) Application Layer (Layer 7): This is the last layer of the OSI Reference Model and is the one that is close to the end-user. Both end-user and application layer interacts with the software application. This layer provides services for email, file transfer, etc.\n\n        `}\n              />\n              <QuestionCard\n                question={`Q #7) What is the difference between Hub, Switch, and Router?`}\n                answer={`Answer:\n\n        Hub\t:- Hub is least expensive, least intelligent and least complicated of the three.\n        It broadcast all data to every port which may cause serious security and reliability concern\tIn a Network, Hub is a common connection point for devices connected to the network. Hub contains multiple ports and is used to connect segments of LAN\n        \n        Switch\t:- Switches work similarly like Hubs but in a more efficient manner.\n        It creates connections dynamically and provides information only to the requesting port Switch is a device in a network which forwards packets in a network\n        \n        Router:- The router is smartest and most complicated out of these three.

TCP/IP specifies how data should be packaged, transmitted and routed in their end to end data communication\n        \n        Given below is a brief explanation of each layer:\n\n        Application Layer: This is the top layer in the TCP/IP model. It includes processes that use the Transport Layer Protocol to transmit the data to their destination. There are different Application Layer Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP protocols, etc.\n        \n        Transport Layer: It receives the data from the Application Layer which is above the Transport Layer. It acts as a backbone between the host's system connected with each other and it mainly concerns about the transmission of data. TCP and UDP are mainly used as Transport Layer protocols.\n        \n        Network or Internet Layer: This layer sends the packets across the network. Packets mainly contain source & destination IP addresses and actual data to be transmitted.\n        \n        Network Interface Layer: It is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. It transfers the packets between different hosts. It includes encapsulation of IP packets into frames, mapping IP addresses to physical hardware devices, etc.`}\n              />\n\n              <QuestionCard\n                question={`Q #9) What is HTTP and what port does it use?`}\n                answer={`Answer: HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is responsible for web content. Many web pages are using HTTP to transmit the web content and allow the display and navigation of HyperText.

HTTPs is used for secure communication over a computer network.

Since, Java is known for its simplicity of code, adding the concept of pointers will be contradicting.

It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it.

It says that every scalar value in the database must be correctly/logically addressable.\n        Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values: The DBMS must allow each tuple to remain null.\n        Rule 4: Active online catalog (database’s structure) based on the relational model: The system must support an online, relational etc. structure which is ingressive to allowed users by means of their regular query.\n        Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage: The system has to assist a minimum of one relational language that:\n        1.Has a linear syntax\n        2.Which can be used as both interactively and within application programs,\n        3.It supports data definition operations(DDL), data manipulation operations(DML), security and integrity constraints, and transaction management operations (begin, commit, and rollback).\n        Rule 6: The view updating rule: All views that theoretically improve must be upgradable by the system.\n        Rule 7: High-level insert, update, and delete: The system must support insert, update, and delete operators.\n        Rule 8: Physical data independence: Modify the physical level (how the data is stored, using arrays or linked lists etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\n        Rule 9: Logical data independence: Modify the logical level (tables, columns, rows etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\n        Rule 10: Integrity independence: Integrity constraints must be identified individually from application programs and stored in the catalog.\n        Rule 11: Distribution independence: The distribution of portions of a database to different locations should not be visible to users of the database.\n        Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule: If the system provides a low-level (i.e. records) interface, then that interface can’t be used to subvert the system.`}\n              />\n              <QuestionCard\n                question={`6.What is normalization? and what explains different normalization forms?`}\n                answer={`Database normalization is a process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy. Which in turn ensures data consistency. There are many problems associated with data redundancy such as disk space wastage, data inconsistency, DML (Data Manipulation Language) queries become slow. There are different normalisation forms: – 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF,5NF, ONF, DKNF.\n        1.1NF: – The data in each column should be atomic number multiple values separated by a comma. The table does not contain any repeating column groups.

This model is of sequential form and moves downward without any deviations. Every phase will start only after the completion of the previous one. This process was being followed for a long time and a traditional approach and has been the best one since agile is adopted recently. This type of model does not involve any kind of frequent requirement changes and needs follows clear documentation from the beginning to the end.

The CMMI level is used to determine the quality or maturity of a software development process in an organization i.e. either software or hardware. It will be used to assess the organization on a scale of five different levels and the processes being followed in the organization.

It is not easier and also not possible to go back to any stage or phase during the Software Development Process. No software product or service will be delivered until the last stages or phases of the Software Development Life Cycle which will be a form of risk. The process of testing can also be completed only after the completion of the Development phase and also cannot be carried out in parallel.`}\n              />\n              <QuestionCard\n                question={`Q6.
