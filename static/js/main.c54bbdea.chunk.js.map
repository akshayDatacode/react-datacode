A real world analogy for polymorphism is a button. Everyone knows how to use a button: you simply apply pressure to it. What a button “does,” however, depends on what it is connected to and the context in which it is used — but the result does not affect how it is used.

As a result of the declaration, we tell the compiler to reserve the space for a variable in the memory according to the data type specified.\r\n\r\n             Example:\r\n             \r\n             int Result;\r\n             char c;\r\n             int a,b,c;\r\n             All the above are valid declarations.

The variable remains active only inside the block and is not accessible outside the code block.\r\n             Global Scope: A variable has a global scope when it is accessible throughout the program.

This is because, although both the variables have the same name, the compiler has given preference to the local scope.`}\r\n                  />\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`Q #6) When there are a Global variable and Local variable with the same name, how will you access the global variable?\r\n\r\n             `}\r\n                    answer={`Answer: When there are two variables with the same name but different scope, i.e. one is a local variable and the other is a global variable, the compiler will give preference to a local variable.\r\n\r\n             In order to access the global variable, we make use of a “scope resolution operator (::)”.

This way is similar to that of declaring a variable, but with a const prefix.\r\n             \r\n             Examples of declaring a constant\r\n             \r\n             const int pi = 3.142;\r\n             const char c = “sth”;\r\n             const zipcode = 411014;\r\n             \r\n             In the above examples, whenever the type of a constant is not specified, the C++ compiler defaults it to an integer type.`}\r\n                  />\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`Q #10) Comment on Assignment Operator in C++.\r\n\r\n             `}\r\n                    answer={`Answer: Assignment operator in C++ is used to assign a value to another variable.\r\n\r\n             a = 5;\r\n             \r\n             This line of code assigns the integer value 5 to variable a.\r\n             \r\n             The part at the left of the =operator is known as an lvalue (left value) and the right as rvalue (right value). Lvalue must always be a variable whereas the right side can be a constant, a variable, the result of an operation or any combination of them.\r\n             \r\n             The assignment operation always takes place from the right to left and never at the inverse.\r\n             \r\n             One property which C++ has over the other programming languages is that the assignment operator can be used as the rvalue (or part of an rvalue) for another assignment.\r\n             \r\n             Example:\r\n             \r\n             a = 2 + (b = 5);\r\n             \r\n             is equivalent to:\r\n             \r\n             b = 5;\r\n             a = 2 + b;\r\n             \r\n             Which means, first assign 5 to variable b and then assign to a, the value 2 plus the result of the previous expression of b(that is 5), leaves a with a final value of 7.\r\n             \r\n             Thus, the following expression is also valid in C++:\r\n             \r\n             a = b = c = 5;\r\n             \r\n             assign 5 to variables a, b and c.`}\r\n                  />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n              <div

with each other to communicate and share information and resources like hardware, data, and software. In a network, nodes are used to connect two or more networks.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #2) What is a Node?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: Two or more computers are connected directly by an optical fiber or any other cable. A node is a point where a connection is established. It is a network component that is used to send, receive and forward the electronic information.\r\n\r\n        A device connected to a network is also termed as Node. Let's consider that in a network there are 2 computers, 2 printers, and a server are connected, then we can say that there are five nodes on the network.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #3) What is Network Topology?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: Network topology is a physical layout of the computer network and it defines how the computers, devices, cables, etc are connected to each other.\r\n\r\n        `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #4) What are Routers?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: The router is a network device that connects two or more network segments. It is used to transfer information from the source to the destination.\r\n\r\n        Routers send the information in terms of data packets and when these data packets are forwarded from one router to another router then the router reads the network address in the packets and identifies the destination network.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #5) What is the OSI reference model?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: Open System Interconnection, the name itself suggests that it is a reference model that defines how applications can communicate with each other over a networking system.\r\n\r\n        It also helps to understand the relationship between networks and defines the process of communication in a network.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #6) What are the layers in OSI Reference Models? Describe each layer briefly.`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: Given below are the seven layers of OSI Reference Models:\r\n\r\n        a) Physical Layer (Layer 1): It converts data bits into electrical impulses or radio signals. Example: Ethernet.\r\n\r\n        b) Data Link Layer (Layer 2): At the Data Link layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits and it provides a node to node data transfer. This layer also detects the errors that occurred at Layer 1.\r\n\r\n        c) Network Layer (Layer 3): This layer transfers variable length data sequence from one node to another node in the same network. This variable-length data sequence is also known as “Datagrams”.\r\n\r\n        d) Transport Layer (Layer 4): It transfers data between nodes and also provides acknowledgment of successful data transmission. It keeps track of transmission and sends the segments again if the transmission fails.\r\n\r\n        e) Session Layer (Layer 5): This layer manages and controls the connections between computers. It establishes, coordinates, exchange and terminates the connections between local and remote applications.\r\n\r\n        f) Presentation Layer (Layer 6): It is also called as “Syntax Layer”. Layer 6 transforms the data into the form in which the application layer accepts.\r\n\r\n        g) Application Layer (Layer 7): This is the last layer of the OSI Reference Model and is the one that is close to the end-user. Both end-user and application layer interacts with the software application. This layer provides services for email, file transfer, etc.\r\n\r\n        `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #7) What is the difference between Hub, Switch, and Router?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer:\r\n\r\n        Hub\t:- Hub is least expensive, least intelligent and least complicated of the three.\r\n        It broadcast all data to every port which may cause serious security and reliability concern\tIn a Network, Hub is a common connection point for devices connected to the network. Hub contains multiple ports and is used to connect segments of LAN\r\n        \r\n        Switch\t:- Switches work similarly like Hubs but in a more efficient manner.\r\n        It creates connections dynamically and provides information only to the requesting port Switch is a device in a network which forwards packets in a network\r\n        \r\n        Router:- The router is smartest and most complicated out of these three. It comes in all shapes and sizes. Routers are similar like little computers dedicated for routing network traffic. Routers are located at gateway and forwards data packets`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #8) Explain TCP/IP Model`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: The most widely used and available protocol is TCP/IP i.e. Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. TCP/IP specifies how data should be packaged, transmitted and routed in their end to end data communication\r\n        \r\n        Given below is a brief explanation of each layer:\r\n\r\n        Application Layer: This is the top layer in the TCP/IP model. It includes processes that use the Transport Layer Protocol to transmit the data to their destination. There are different Application Layer Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP protocols, etc.\r\n        \r\n        Transport Layer: It receives the data from the Application Layer which is above the Transport Layer. It acts as a backbone between the host's system connected with each other and it mainly concerns about the transmission of data. TCP and UDP are mainly used as Transport Layer protocols.\r\n        \r\n        Network or Internet Layer: This layer sends the packets across the network. Packets mainly contain source & destination IP addresses and actual data to be transmitted.\r\n        \r\n        Network Interface Layer: It is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. It transfers the packets between different hosts. It includes encapsulation of IP packets into frames, mapping IP addresses to physical hardware devices, etc.`}\r\n              />\r\n\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #9) What is HTTP and what port does it use?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is responsible for web content. Many web pages are using HTTP to transmit the web content and allow the display and navigation of HyperText. It is the primary protocol and port used here is TCP port 80.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #10) What is HTTPs and what port does it use?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: HTTPs is a Secure HTTP. HTTPs is used for secure communication over a computer network. HTTPs provides authentication of websites that prevents unwanted attacks.\r\n        In bi-directional communication, the HTTPs protocol encrypts the communication so that the tampering of the data gets avoided. With the help of an SSL certificate, it verifies if the requested server connection is a valid connection or not. HTTPs use TCP with port 443.`}\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n              \r\n              <div className=\"row\">\r\n                <div className=\"col\">\r\n                  <h4 className=\"text-primary\">For More Technologies</h4>\r\n                  <InterviewQuestionCardCarousel />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>    \r\n               \r\n            <div className=\"col-md-4 mt-5\">\r\n              <h5 className=\"mb-4\">Other Learning Resources</h5>\r\n              <RoadMapCard\r\n                imgsource=\"cn_tech.jpeg\"\r\n                title=\"Top 47 Networking Interview Questions\"\r\n                source=\"(javatpoint)\"\r\n                tag1=\"Interview Questions\"\r\n                link=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/networking-interview-questions\"\r\n              />\r\n             <RoadMapCard\r\n                imgsource=\"cn_tech.jpeg\"\r\n                title=\"Commonly asked Computer Networks Interview Questions\"\r\n                source=\"()\"\r\n                tag1=\"Networks\"\r\n                tag2=\"Questions\"\r\n                link=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/commonly-asked-computer-networks-interview-questions-set-1/\"\r\n              />\r\n               <RoadMapCard\r\n                imgsource=\"cn_tech.jpeg\"\r\n                title=\"Hardware and Networking Interview Questions & Answers\"\r\n                source=\"(learning.naukri)\"\r\n                tag1=\" interview\"\r\n                link=\"https://learning.naukri.com/articles/networking-interview-questions-answers/\"\r\n              />\r\n               <RoadMapCard\r\n                imgsource=\"cn_tech.jpeg\"\r\n                title=\"TOP 250+ Networking Interview Questions and Answers \"\r\n                source=\"(wisdom jobs)\"\r\n                tag1=\"Computer Network\"\r\n                link=\"https://www.wisdomjobs.com/e-university/networking-interview-questions.html\"\r\n              />\r\n               <RoadMapCard\r\n                imgsource=\"cn_tech.jpeg\"\r\n                title=\"10 Basic Interview Questions and Answers \"\r\n                source=\"(tecmint)\"\r\n                tag1=\"computer  network \"\r\n                link=\"https://www.tecmint.com/networking-interview-questions/\"\r\n              />\r\n               <RoadMapCard\r\n                imgsource=\"cn_tech.jpeg\"\r\n                title=\"Networking Interview Questions updated on Apr 2020\"\r\n                source=\"(placement.freshersworld)\"\r\n                tag1=\"network \"\r\n                link=\"http://placement.freshersworld.com/networking-interview-questions/33121835176\"\r\n              />\r\n              <RightSideSection />\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CNInterviewQuestions;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport QuestionCard from \"./QuestionCard\";\r\nimport RightSideSection from \"../../../right_section/RightSideSection\";\r\nimport RecommendPost from \"../../../right_section/RecommendPost\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport RoadMapCard from \"../../technologies/RoadMapCard\";\r\nimport InterviewQuestionCardCarousel from \"./InterviewQuestionCardCarousel\";\r\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from \"@fortawesome/react-fontawesome\";\r\nimport { faHome } from \"@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons\";\r\n\r\nclass DataStructureInterviewQuestions extends Component {\r\n  state = {};\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <>\r\n        <div className=\"container-fluids\">\r\n          <div className=\"row\">\r\n            <div className=\"col\">\r\n              <div className=\"card bg-dark\">\r\n                <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n                  <h1 className=\"card-title text-light display-5 \">\r\n                    DataStructure Interview Question\r\n                  </h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"row mt-5 mb-5\">\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-1\"></div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-7 \">\r\n              <Link to=\"/home\" className=\"badge badge-primary mr-1\">\r\n                <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHome} size=\"1x\" />\r\n              </Link>\r\n              <Link\r\n                to=\"/index_interview_questioins\"\r\n                className=\"badge badge-warning mr-1\"\r\n              >\r\n                Interview Questions >>\r\n              </Link>\r\n              <div className=\"row mb-5\">\r\n                <div className=\"col\">\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`1) What is Data Structure?

The default implementation uses == operator to compare two objects. For example: method can be overridden like String class. equals() method is used to compare the values of two objects.\r\n             `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q5. What is a package in Java?

By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused. Below I have listed down a few of its advantages:\r\n             Packages help in avoiding name clashes\r\n             They provide easier access control on the code\r\n             Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package\r\n             Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes\r\n             `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q6. Why pointers are not used in Java?\r\n             `}\r\n                answer={`Java doesn’t use pointers because they are unsafe and increases the complexity of the program. Since, Java is known for its simplicity of code, adding the concept of pointers will be contradicting. Moreover, since JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order to avoid direct access to memory by the user,  pointers are discouraged in Java.\r\n`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q7. What is JIT compiler in Java?\r\n             `}\r\n                answer={`JIT stands for Just-In-Time compiler in Java. It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it. This is why it is often responsible for the performance optimization of Java applications at the run time.\r\n             `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q8.

An object has three characteristics:\r\n             State\r\n             Behavior\r\n             Identity\r\n             An object is created using the ‘new’ keyword.

Codd.\r\n        Codd’s rules: –\r\n        Rule 0: The system has to qualify as Relational, as a Database, and also as a Management System.\r\n        Rule 1: The information rule: Each and every information in the database is to be represented uniquely, mainly name values in column positions within a different row of a table.\r\n        Rule 2: The guaranteed access rule: All data must be ingressive. It says that every scalar value in the database must be correctly/logically addressable.\r\n        Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values: The DBMS must allow each tuple to remain null.\r\n        Rule 4: Active online catalog (database’s structure) based on the relational model: The system must support an online, relational etc. structure which is ingressive to allowed users by means of their regular query.\r\n        Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage: The system has to assist a minimum of one relational language that:\r\n        1.Has a linear syntax\r\n        2.Which can be used as both interactively and within application programs,\r\n        3.It supports data definition operations(DDL), data manipulation operations(DML), security and integrity constraints, and transaction management operations (begin, commit, and rollback).\r\n        Rule 6: The view updating rule: All views that theoretically improve must be upgradable by the system.\r\n        Rule 7: High-level insert, update, and delete: The system must support insert, update, and delete operators.\r\n        Rule 8: Physical data independence: Modify the physical level (how the data is stored, using arrays or linked lists etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\r\n        Rule 9: Logical data independence: Modify the logical level (tables, columns, rows etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\r\n        Rule 10: Integrity independence: Integrity constraints must be identified individually from application programs and stored in the catalog.\r\n        Rule 11: Distribution independence: The distribution of portions of a database to different locations should not be visible to users of the database.\r\n        Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule: If the system provides a low-level (i.e. records) interface, then that interface can’t be used to subvert the system.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`6.What is normalization? and what explains different normalization forms?`}\r\n                answer={`Database normalization is a process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy. Which in turn ensures data consistency. There are many problems associated with data redundancy such as disk space wastage, data inconsistency, DML (Data Manipulation Language) queries become slow. There are different normalisation forms: – 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF,5NF, ONF, DKNF.\r\n        1.1NF: – The data in each column should be atomic number multiple values separated by a comma. The table does not contain any repeating column groups. Identity each record uniquely using the primary key.\r\n        2.2NF: – The table should match all the conditions of 1NF and move redundant data to a separate table. Moreover, it creates a relationship between these tables using foreign keys.\r\n        3.3NF: – for a 3NF table should fulfill all the conditions of 1NF and 2NF. 3NF doesn’t contain attributes which are partially dependent upon primary key.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`7.

A primary key can be defined at column level or table level. Only one primary key per table is allowed.\r\n        Foreign key: foreign key allows the values present in the referenced column only. It allows duplicate or null values. It can be defined as a column level or table level. It can reference a column of a unique/primary key.\r\n        Candidate Key: A Candidate key is minimum super key, there is no proper subgroup of Candidate key attributes can be a super key.\r\n        Super Key: A superkey is a set of attributes of a relation schema on which all attributes of the schema are partially dependent.

Therefore, only one clustered index can be created to a database table.\r\n        Non-clustered index: – It does not define physical data but it defines a logical ordering.

What are the different phases of the Waterfall model?\r\n`}\r\n                answer={`The different phases or steps involved in the waterfall model are Requirements, Design, Execution, Testing, and Release. This model is of sequential form and moves downward without any deviations. Every phase will start only after the completion of the previous one. This process was being followed for a long time and a traditional approach and has been the best one since agile is adopted recently. This type of model does not involve any kind of frequent requirement changes and needs follows clear documentation from the beginning to the end. The phases and activities are well planned.\r\n\r\n`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q4. What is CMM Maturity Level and what is its importance?\r\n`}\r\n                answer={`The CMM (Capability Maturity Model) is a standard or benchmark which is used in the process of the development model in an organization to study or know the maturity of the processes being followed in an organization. The CMMI level is used to determine the quality or maturity of a software development process in an organization i.e. either software or hardware. It will be used to assess the organization on a scale of five different levels and the processes being followed in the organization. The five different levels are Initial, Repeatable, Defined, Capable (Managed) and Efficient (Optimizing).`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q5. What are the drawbacks of Waterfall model?\r\n`}\r\n                answer={`The drawbacks of the waterfall model are – It will not be ideal for larger and complex projects when the requirements are not clearly documented and not clear. It is not easier and also not possible to go back to any stage or phase during the Software Development Process. No software product or service will be delivered until the last stages or phases of the Software Development Life Cycle which will be a form of risk. The process of testing can also be completed only after the completion of the Development phase and also cannot be carried out in parallel.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q6.

Testers or Analysts in the Testing Phase. Project Manager, Program Manager, and Maintenance Team will be in the Maintenance phase of the Software Development Life Cycle process. The team members involved in the different project phases also depends on the structure of the organization and the roles and responsibilities being followed or maintained by the particular organization.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q7. What are LLDs or HLDs in SDLC?\r\n`}\r\n                answer={`The LLD (Low-Level Design) and HLD (High-level Design) are used to analyze and understand the project in a high level and low-level overview to different types of team members to the customers depending on the technical or business knowledge of the person. The Low-level Design is a detailed design implementation which will be helpful in the development process for the Developers whereas the High-Level Design will be given by Architects to proceed with the development process initially. This will be easier to know or look at a glance to understand about the project easily.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q8.

The middle will not point to anything hence, simply set it to null.\r\nWhen a node is successfully added into the list then, call convertTernaryToDLL() recursively to add a left, middle and right child of given node to the list.\r\na. displayDLL() will show all the nodes present in the list.\r\n\r\nDefine a new node 'current' that will point to the head.\r\nPrint current.data till current points to null.\r\nCurrent will point to the next node in the list in each iteration.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM:\r\n#Represent a node of ternary tree    \r\nclass Node:    \r\n    def __init__(self,data):    \r\n        self.data = data;    \r\n        self.left = None;    \r\n        self.middle = None;    \r\n        self.right = None;    \r\n            \r\nclass TernaryTreeToDLL:    \r\n    def __init__(self):    \r\n        #Represent the root of ternary tree    \r\n        self.root = None;    \r\n        #Represent the head and tail of the doubly linked list    \r\n        self.head = None;    \r\n        self.tail = None;    \r\n            \r\n    #convertTernaryToDLL() will convert the given ternary tree to corresponding doubly linked list    \r\n    def convertTernaryToDLL(self, node):    \r\n        #Checks whether node is None    \r\n        if(node == None):    \r\n            return;    \r\n                \r\n        #Keep three pointers to all three children    \r\n        left = node.left;    \r\n        middle = node.middle;    \r\n        right = node.right;    \r\n            \r\n        #If list is empty then, add node as head of the list    \r\n        if(self.head == None):    \r\n            #Both head and tail will point to node    \r\n            self.head = self.tail = node;    \r\n            node.middle = None;    \r\n            #head's left will point to None    \r\n            self.head.left = None;    \r\n            #tail's right will point to None, as it is the last node of the list    \r\n            self.tail.right = None;    \r\n        #Otherwise, add node to the end of the list    \r\n        else:    \r\n            #node will be added after tail such that tail's right will point to node    \r\n            self.tail.right = node;    \r\n            #node's left will point to tail    \r\n            node.left = self.tail;    \r\n            node.middle = None;    \r\n            #node will become new tail    \r\n            self.tail = node;    \r\n            #As it is last node, tail's right will point to None    \r\n            self.tail.right = None;    \r\n                \r\n        #Add left child of current node to the list    \r\n        self.convertTernaryToDLL(left);    \r\n        #Then, add middle child of current node to the list    \r\n        self.convertTernaryToDLL(middle);    \r\n        #Then, add right child of current node to the list    \r\n        self.convertTernaryToDLL(right);    \r\n        \r\n    #displayDLL() will print out the nodes of the list    \r\n    def displayDLL(self):    \r\n        #Node current will point to head    \r\n        current = self.head;    \r\n        if(self.head == None):    \r\n            print(\"List is empty\");    \r\n            return;    \r\n        print(\"Nodes of generated doubly linked list: \");    \r\n        while(current != None):    \r\n            #Prints each node by incrementing pointer.    \r\n            print(current.data),    \r\n            current = current.right;    \r\n                \r\ntree = TernaryTreeToDLL();    \r\n#Add nodes to the ternary tree    \r\ntree.root = Node(5);    \r\ntree.root.left = Node(10);    \r\ntree.root.middle = Node(12);    \r\ntree.root.right = Node(15);    \r\ntree.root.left.left = Node(20);    \r\ntree.root.left.middle = Node(40);    \r\ntree.root.left.right = Node(50);    \r\ntree.root.middle.left = Node(24);    \r\ntree.root.middle.middle = Node(36);    \r\ntree.root.middle.right = Node(48);    \r\ntree.root.right.left = Node(30);    \r\ntree.root.right.middle = Node(45);    \r\ntree.root.right.right = Node(60);    \r\n     \r\n#Converts the given ternary tree to doubly linked list    \r\ntree.convertTernaryToDLL(tree.root);    \r\n     \r\n#Displays the nodes present in the list    \r\ntree.displayDLL();    \r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\nNodes of generated doubly linked list: \r\n5 10 20 40 50 12 24 36 48 15 30 45 60 `}\r\n                    />\r\n                    <ProgramCard\r\n                      heading=\"Python program to create a doubly linked list of n nodes and count the number of nodes\"\r\n                      language=\"python\"\r\n                      code={`ALGORITHM:\r\nDefine a Node class which represents a node in the list.
