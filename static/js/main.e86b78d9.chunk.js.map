Lvalue must always be a variable whereas the right side can be a constant, a variable, the result of an operation or any combination of them.\r\n             \r\n             The assignment operation always takes place from the right to left and never at the inverse.\r\n             \r\n             One property which C++ has over the other programming languages is that the assignment operator can be used as the rvalue (or part of an rvalue) for another assignment.\r\n             \r\n             Example:\r\n             \r\n             a = 2 + (b = 5);\r\n             \r\n             is equivalent to:\r\n             \r\n             b = 5;\r\n             a = 2 + b;\r\n             \r\n             Which means, first assign 5 to variable b and then assign to a, the value 2 plus the result of the previous expression of b(that is 5), leaves a with a final value of 7.\r\n             \r\n             Thus, the following expression is also valid in C++:\r\n             \r\n             a = b = c = 5;\r\n             \r\n             assign 5 to variables a, b and c.`}\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-4 mt-5\">\r\n              <h5 className=\"mb-4\">Other Learning Resources</h5>\r\n              <RecommendPost\r\n                imgsource=\"indexcover1.jpeg\"\r\n                RecPostHading=\"Interview Heading\"\r\n              />\r\n              <RecommendPost\r\n                imgsource=\"indexcover1.jpeg\"\r\n                RecPostHading=\"Interview Heading\"\r\n              />\r\n              <RecommendPost\r\n                imgsource=\"indexcover1.jpeg\"\r\n                RecPostHading=\"Interview Heading\"\r\n              />\r\n              <RecommendPost\r\n                imgsource=\"indexcover1.jpeg\"\r\n                RecPostHading=\"Interview Heading\"\r\n              />\r\n              <RecommendPost\r\n                imgsource=\"indexcover1.jpeg\"\r\n                RecPostHading=\"Interview Heading\"\r\n              />\r\n              <RecommendPost\r\n                imgsource=\"indexcover1.jpeg\"\r\n                RecPostHading=\"Interview Heading\"\r\n              />\r\n\r\n              <RightSideSection />\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <FooterComponentUpper />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CppInterviewQuestions;\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport QuestionCard from \"./QuestionCard\";\r\nimport RightSideSection from \"../../../right_section/RightSideSection\";\r\nimport RecommendPost from \"../../../right_section/RecommendPost\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nclass CloudComputingInterviewQuestions extends Component {\r\n  state = {};\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <>\r\n        <div className=\"container-fluids\">\r\n          <div className=\"row\">\r\n            <div className=\"col\">\r\n              <div className=\"card bg-primary\">\r\n                <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n                  <h1 className=\"card-title text-light display-5 \">\r\n                    Cloud Computing Interview Question\r\n                  </h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"row mt-5 mb-5\">\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-1\"></div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-7 \">\r\n              <Link to=\"/home\" className=\"badge badge-primary mr-1\">\r\n                Home >\r\n              </Link>\r\n              <Link\r\n                to=\"/index_interview_questioins\"\r\n                className=\"badge badge-warning mr-1\"\r\n              >\r\n                Interview Questions >\r\n              </Link>\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`1) What is cloud computing?\r\n`}\r\n                answer={`Cloud computing is an internet based new age computer technology.

This layer also detects the errors that occurred at Layer 1.\r\n\r\n        c) Network Layer (Layer 3): This layer transfers variable length data sequence from one node to another node in the same network. This variable-length data sequence is also known as “Datagrams”.\r\n\r\n        d) Transport Layer (Layer 4): It transfers data between nodes and also provides acknowledgment of successful data transmission. It keeps track of transmission and sends the segments again if the transmission fails.\r\n\r\n        e) Session Layer (Layer 5): This layer manages and controls the connections between computers. It establishes, coordinates, exchange and terminates the connections between local and remote applications.\r\n\r\n        f) Presentation Layer (Layer 6): It is also called as “Syntax Layer”.

It includes processes that use the Transport Layer Protocol to transmit the data to their destination. There are different Application Layer Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP protocols, etc.\r\n        \r\n        Transport Layer: It receives the data from the Application Layer which is above the Transport Layer. It acts as a backbone between the host's system connected with each other and it mainly concerns about the transmission of data. TCP and UDP are mainly used as Transport Layer protocols.\r\n        \r\n        Network or Internet Layer: This layer sends the packets across the network. Packets mainly contain source & destination IP addresses and actual data to be transmitted.\r\n        \r\n        Network Interface Layer: It is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. It transfers the packets between different hosts. It includes encapsulation of IP packets into frames, mapping IP addresses to physical hardware devices, etc.`}\r\n              />\r\n\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #9) What is HTTP and what port does it use?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is responsible for web content.

It says that every scalar value in the database must be correctly/logically addressable.\r\n        Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values: The DBMS must allow each tuple to remain null.\r\n        Rule 4: Active online catalog (database’s structure) based on the relational model: The system must support an online, relational etc. structure which is ingressive to allowed users by means of their regular query.\r\n        Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage: The system has to assist a minimum of one relational language that:\r\n        1.Has a linear syntax\r\n        2.Which can be used as both interactively and within application programs,\r\n        3.It supports data definition operations(DDL), data manipulation operations(DML), security and integrity constraints, and transaction management operations (begin, commit, and rollback).\r\n        Rule 6: The view updating rule: All views that theoretically improve must be upgradable by the system.\r\n        Rule 7: High-level insert, update, and delete: The system must support insert, update, and delete operators.\r\n        Rule 8: Physical data independence: Modify the physical level (how the data is stored, using arrays or linked lists etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\r\n        Rule 9: Logical data independence: Modify the logical level (tables, columns, rows etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\r\n        Rule 10: Integrity independence: Integrity constraints must be identified individually from application programs and stored in the catalog.\r\n        Rule 11: Distribution independence: The distribution of portions of a database to different locations should not be visible to users of the database.\r\n        Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule: If the system provides a low-level (i.e. records) interface, then that interface can’t be used to subvert the system.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`6.What is normalization? and what explains different normalization forms?`}\r\n                answer={`Database normalization is a process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy.
