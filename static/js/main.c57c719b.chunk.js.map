The “instanceof” operator in java determines the “IS-A” relationship.\r\n\r\n                When a class A has a member reference variable of type B then A “HAS-A” B. It is also known as Aggregation.\r\n                \r\n                `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`20.What is the difference between

Also, note that as a result of the declaration, the value of the variable is undetermined.\r\n             \r\n             Whereas, a definition is an implementation/instantiation of the declared variable where we tie up appropriate value to the declared variable so that the linker will be able to link references to the appropriate entities.\r\n             \r\n             From above Example,\r\n             \r\n             Result = 10;\r\n             \r\n             C = ‘A’;\r\n             \r\n             These are valid definitions.`}\r\n                  />\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`Q #4) Comment on Local and Global scope of a variable.\r\n\r\n             `}\r\n                    answer={`Answer: The scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable remains active i.e. it can be declared, defined or worked with.\r\n\r\n             There are two types of scope in C++:\r\n             \r\n             Local Scope: A variable is said to have a local scope or is local when it is declared inside a code block. The variable remains active only inside the block and is not accessible outside the code block.\r\n             Global Scope: A variable has a global scope when it is accessible throughout the program.

Using this operator, we can access the value of the global variable.\r\n             \r\n             Example:\r\n             \r\n             #include<iostream.h>\r\n             int x= 10;\r\n             int main()\r\n             {\r\n              int x= 2;\r\n              cout<<”Global Variable x = “<<::x;\r\n              cout<<”/nlocal Variable x= “<<x;\r\n             }\r\n             Output:\r\n             \r\n             Global Variable x = 10\r\n             local Variable x= 2\r\n             `}\r\n                  />\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`Q #7) How many ways are there to initialize an int with a Constant?\r\n\r\n             `}\r\n                    answer={`Answer: There are two ways:\r\n\r\n             The first format uses traditional C notation.\r\n             int result = 10;\r\n             The second format uses the constructor notation.\r\n             int result (10);`}\r\n                  />\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`Q #8) What is a Constant?

This way is similar to that of declaring a variable, but with a const prefix.\r\n             \r\n             Examples of declaring a constant\r\n             \r\n             const int pi = 3.142;\r\n             const char c = “sth”;\r\n             const zipcode = 411014;\r\n             \r\n             In the above examples, whenever the type of a constant is not specified, the C++ compiler defaults it to an integer type.`}\r\n                  />\r\n                  <QuestionCard\r\n                    question={`Q #10) Comment on Assignment Operator in C++.\r\n\r\n             `}\r\n                    answer={`Answer: Assignment operator in C++ is used to assign a value to another variable.\r\n\r\n             a = 5;\r\n             \r\n             This line of code assigns the integer value 5 to variable a.\r\n             \r\n             The part at the left of the =operator is known as an lvalue (left value) and the right as rvalue (right value). Lvalue must always be a variable whereas the right side can be a constant, a variable, the result of an operation or any combination of them.\r\n             \r\n             The assignment operation always takes place from the right to left and never at the inverse.\r\n             \r\n             One property which C++ has over the other programming languages is that the assignment operator can be used as the rvalue (or part of an rvalue) for another assignment.\r\n             \r\n             Example:\r\n             \r\n             a = 2 + (b = 5);\r\n             \r\n             is equivalent to:\r\n             \r\n             b = 5;\r\n             a = 2 + b;\r\n             \r\n             Which means, first assign 5 to variable b and then assign to a, the value 2 plus the result of the previous expression of b(that is 5), leaves a with a final value of 7.\r\n             \r\n             Thus, the following expression is also valid in C++:\r\n             \r\n             a = b = c = 5;\r\n             \r\n             assign 5 to variables a, b and c.`}\r\n                  />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n              <div

Describe each layer briefly.`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: Given below are the seven layers of OSI Reference Models:\r\n\r\n        a) Physical Layer (Layer 1): It converts data bits into electrical impulses or radio signals. Example: Ethernet.\r\n\r\n        b) Data Link Layer (Layer 2): At the Data Link layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits and it provides a node to node data transfer. This layer also detects the errors that occurred at Layer 1.\r\n\r\n        c) Network Layer (Layer 3): This layer transfers variable length data sequence from one node to another node in the same network. This variable-length data sequence is also known as “Datagrams”.\r\n\r\n        d) Transport Layer (Layer 4): It transfers data between nodes and also provides acknowledgment of successful data transmission. It keeps track of transmission and sends the segments again if the transmission fails.\r\n\r\n        e) Session Layer (Layer 5): This layer manages and controls the connections between computers. It establishes, coordinates, exchange and terminates the connections between local and remote applications.\r\n\r\n        f) Presentation Layer (Layer 6): It is also called as “Syntax Layer”. Layer 6 transforms the data into the form in which the application layer accepts.\r\n\r\n        g) Application Layer (Layer 7): This is the last layer of the OSI Reference Model and is the one that is close to the end-user. Both end-user and application layer interacts with the software application. This layer provides services for email, file transfer, etc.\r\n\r\n        `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #7) What is the difference between Hub, Switch, and Router?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer:\r\n\r\n        Hub\t:- Hub is least expensive, least intelligent and least complicated of the three.\r\n        It broadcast all data to every port which may cause serious security and reliability concern\tIn a Network, Hub is a common connection point for devices connected to the network. Hub contains multiple ports and is used to connect segments of LAN\r\n        \r\n        Switch\t:- Switches work similarly like Hubs but in a more efficient manner.\r\n        It creates connections dynamically and provides information only to the requesting port Switch is a device in a network which forwards packets in a network\r\n        \r\n        Router:- The router is smartest and most complicated out of these three.

TCP/IP specifies how data should be packaged, transmitted and routed in their end to end data communication\r\n        \r\n        Given below is a brief explanation of each layer:\r\n\r\n        Application Layer: This is the top layer in the TCP/IP model. It includes processes that use the Transport Layer Protocol to transmit the data to their destination. There are different Application Layer Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP protocols, etc.\r\n        \r\n        Transport Layer: It receives the data from the Application Layer which is above the Transport Layer. It acts as a backbone between the host's system connected with each other and it mainly concerns about the transmission of data. TCP and UDP are mainly used as Transport Layer protocols.\r\n        \r\n        Network or Internet Layer: This layer sends the packets across the network. Packets mainly contain source & destination IP addresses and actual data to be transmitted.\r\n        \r\n        Network Interface Layer: It is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. It transfers the packets between different hosts. It includes encapsulation of IP packets into frames, mapping IP addresses to physical hardware devices, etc.`}\r\n              />\r\n\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q #9) What is HTTP and what port does it use?`}\r\n                answer={`Answer: HTTP is HyperText Transfer Protocol and it is responsible for web content. Many web pages are using HTTP to transmit the web content and allow the display and navigation of HyperText.

HTTPs is used for secure communication over a computer network. HTTPs provides authentication of websites that prevents unwanted attacks.\r\n        In bi-directional communication, the HTTPs protocol encrypts the communication so that the tampering of the data gets avoided. With the help of an SSL certificate, it verifies if the requested server connection is a valid connection or not.

Since, Java is known for its simplicity of code, adding the concept of pointers will be contradicting.

What is JIT compiler in Java?\r\n             `}\r\n                answer={`JIT stands for Just-In-Time compiler in Java. It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it. This is why it is often responsible for the performance optimization of Java applications at the run time.\r\n             `}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`Q8.

It says that every scalar value in the database must be correctly/logically addressable.\r\n        Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values: The DBMS must allow each tuple to remain null.\r\n        Rule 4: Active online catalog (database’s structure) based on the relational model: The system must support an online, relational etc. structure which is ingressive to allowed users by means of their regular query.\r\n        Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage: The system has to assist a minimum of one relational language that:\r\n        1.Has a linear syntax\r\n        2.Which can be used as both interactively and within application programs,\r\n        3.It supports data definition operations(DDL), data manipulation operations(DML), security and integrity constraints, and transaction management operations (begin, commit, and rollback).\r\n        Rule 6: The view updating rule: All views that theoretically improve must be upgradable by the system.\r\n        Rule 7: High-level insert, update, and delete: The system must support insert, update, and delete operators.\r\n        Rule 8: Physical data independence: Modify the physical level (how the data is stored, using arrays or linked lists etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\r\n        Rule 9: Logical data independence: Modify the logical level (tables, columns, rows etc.) must not require a modification to an application.\r\n        Rule 10: Integrity independence: Integrity constraints must be identified individually from application programs and stored in the catalog.\r\n        Rule 11: Distribution independence: The distribution of portions of a database to different locations should not be visible to users of the database.\r\n        Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule: If the system provides a low-level (i.e. records) interface, then that interface can’t be used to subvert the system.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`6.What is normalization? and what explains different normalization forms?`}\r\n                answer={`Database normalization is a process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy. Which in turn ensures data consistency. There are many problems associated with data redundancy such as disk space wastage, data inconsistency, DML (Data Manipulation Language) queries become slow. There are different normalisation forms: – 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF,5NF, ONF, DKNF.\r\n        1.1NF: – The data in each column should be atomic number multiple values separated by a comma. The table does not contain any repeating column groups. Identity each record uniquely using the primary key.\r\n        2.2NF: – The table should match all the conditions of 1NF and move redundant data to a separate table. Moreover, it creates a relationship between these tables using foreign keys.\r\n        3.3NF: – for a 3NF table should fulfill all the conditions of 1NF and 2NF. 3NF doesn’t contain attributes which are partially dependent upon primary key.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`7. Define primary key, foreign key, candidate key, super key?`}\r\n                answer={`Primary key: The primary key is the key that doesn’t allow duplicate values and null values. A primary key can be defined at column level or table level. Only one primary key per table is allowed.\r\n        Foreign key: foreign key allows the values present in the referenced column only. It allows duplicate or null values. It can be defined as a column level or table level. It can reference a column of a unique/primary key.\r\n        Candidate Key: A Candidate key is minimum super key, there is no proper subgroup of Candidate key attributes can be a super key.\r\n        Super Key: A superkey is a set of attributes of a relation schema on which all attributes of the schema are partially dependent. No two rows can have the same value of super key attributes.`}\r\n              />\r\n              <QuestionCard\r\n                question={`8.

Therefore, only one clustered index can be created to a database table.\r\n        Non-clustered index: – It does not define physical data but it defines a logical ordering.

This model is of sequential form and moves downward without any deviations. Every phase will start only after the completion of the previous one. This process was being followed for a long time and a traditional approach and has been the best one since agile is adopted recently. This type of model does not involve any kind of frequent requirement changes and needs follows clear documentation from the beginning to the end.

The CMMI level is used to determine the quality or maturity of a software development process in an organization i.e. either software or hardware. It will be used to assess the organization on a scale of five different levels and the processes being followed in the organization.

It is not easier and also not possible to go back to any stage or phase during the Software Development Process. No software product or service will be delivered until the last stages or phases of the Software Development Life Cycle which will be a form of risk.

The Low-level Design is a detailed design implementation which will be helpful in the development process for the Developers whereas the High-Level Design will be given by Architects to proceed with the development process initially.

The middle will not point to anything hence, simply set it to null.\r\nWhen a node is successfully added into the list then, call convertTernaryToDLL() recursively to add a left, middle and right child of given node to the list.\r\na. displayDLL() will show all the nodes present in the list.\r\n\r\nDefine a new node 'current' that will point to the head.\r\nPrint current.data till current points to null.\r\nCurrent will point to the next node in the list in each iteration.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM:\r\n#Represent a node of ternary tree    \r\nclass Node:    \r\n    def __init__(self,data):    \r\n        self.data = data;    \r\n        self.left = None;    \r\n        self.middle = None;    \r\n        self.right = None;    \r\n            \r\nclass TernaryTreeToDLL:    \r\n    def __init__(self):    \r\n        #Represent the root of ternary tree    \r\n        self.root = None;    \r\n        #Represent the head and tail of the doubly linked list    \r\n        self.head = None;    \r\n        self.tail = None;    \r\n            \r\n    #convertTernaryToDLL() will convert the given ternary tree to corresponding doubly linked list    \r\n    def convertTernaryToDLL(self, node):    \r\n        #Checks whether node is None    \r\n        if(node == None):    \r\n            return;    \r\n                \r\n        #Keep three pointers to all three children    \r\n        left = node.left;    \r\n        middle = node.middle;    \r\n        right = node.right;    \r\n            \r\n        #If list is empty then, add node as head of the list    \r\n        if(self.head == None):    \r\n            #Both head and tail will point to node    \r\n            self.head = self.tail = node;    \r\n            node.middle = None;    \r\n            #head's left will point to None    \r\n            self.head.left = None;    \r\n            #tail's right will point to None, as it is the last node of the list    \r\n            self.tail.right = None;    \r\n        #Otherwise, add node to the end of the list    \r\n        else:    \r\n            #node will be added after tail such that tail's right will point to node    \r\n            self.tail.right = node;    \r\n            #node's left will point to tail    \r\n            node.left = self.tail;    \r\n            node.middle = None;    \r\n            #node will become new tail    \r\n            self.tail = node;    \r\n            #As it is last node, tail's right will point to None    \r\n            self.tail.right = None;    \r\n                \r\n        #Add left child of current node to the list    \r\n        self.convertTernaryToDLL(left);    \r\n        #Then, add middle child of current node to the list    \r\n        self.convertTernaryToDLL(middle);    \r\n        #Then, add right child of current node to the list    \r\n        self.convertTernaryToDLL(right);    \r\n        \r\n    #displayDLL() will print out the nodes of the list    \r\n    def displayDLL(self):    \r\n        #Node current will point to head    \r\n        current = self.head;    \r\n        if(self.head == None):    \r\n            print(\"List is empty\");    \r\n            return;    \r\n        print(\"Nodes of generated doubly linked list: \");    \r\n        while(current != None):    \r\n            #Prints each node by incrementing pointer.    \r\n            print(current.data),    \r\n            current = current.right;    \r\n                \r\ntree = TernaryTreeToDLL();    \r\n#Add nodes to the ternary tree    \r\ntree.root = Node(5);    \r\ntree.root.left = Node(10);    \r\ntree.root.middle = Node(12);    \r\ntree.root.right = Node(15);    \r\ntree.root.left.left = Node(20);    \r\ntree.root.left.middle = Node(40);    \r\ntree.root.left.right = Node(50);    \r\ntree.root.middle.left = Node(24);    \r\ntree.root.middle.middle = Node(36);    \r\ntree.root.middle.right = Node(48);    \r\ntree.root.right.left = Node(30);    \r\ntree.root.right.middle = Node(45);    \r\ntree.root.right.right = Node(60);    \r\n     \r\n#Converts the given ternary tree to doubly linked list    \r\ntree.convertTernaryToDLL(tree.root);    \r\n     \r\n#Displays the nodes present in the list    \r\ntree.displayDLL();    \r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\nNodes of generated doubly linked list: \r\n5 10 20 40 50 12 24 36 48 15 30 45 60 `}\r\n                    />\r\n                    <ProgramCard\r\n                      heading=\"Python program to create a doubly linked list of n nodes and count the number of nodes\"\r\n                      language=\"python\"\r\n                      code={`ALGORITHM:\r\nDefine a Node class which represents a node in the list.
